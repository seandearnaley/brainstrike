# Platform Contracts: Logging, Factory Reset

> Extracted from AGENTS.md (2026-07-12). Read before adding persistence or changing logging. Keep updated with the code.

## LOGGING (PINO V10)

Centralized logging: packages/utils/src/logger.ts

Usage:
- Use initializeLogging from @brainstrike/utils.
- Set runtime: browser | electron-main | electron-renderer.
- Desktop main:
  - Logs to console + ${app.getPath('logs')}/brainstrike.log
- Web/renderer:
  - Call initializeLogging in main.tsx.

Log levels:
- trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal, silent
- Configure via:
  - setLogLevel(LogLevel.DEBUG)
  - LOG_LEVEL=debug (env)
- Priority: code > env > defaults.

Structured logs:
- Prefer objects:

  logger.info('User authenticated', { userId: '123', method: 'oauth' });

Scoped loggers:
- createLogger('FileImporter')

Sensitive data:
- Auto-redacts: apiKey, password, token, secret, authorization, cookie
- Structured arguments and listener bindings are recursively redacted before transport,
  buffering, or display; transport serializers alone are not a sufficient boundary.
- Add more via redactPaths.

Testing:
- Use addLogListener instead of mocking console.

## FACTORY RESET CONTRACT

“Factory Reset Brainstrike” = true fresh start.

Rules:
- Wiping DB alone is NOT enough.
- Renderer must boot as if never used.

Implementation:
- Update:
  - packages/preferences/src/settings/system/factory-reset-helpers.ts
  - Ensure clearPersistentUiState() includes:
    - All new persistent UI store keys (e.g. `hook-trust-store` — the
      security-sensitive per-root hook approvals; reset drops every approval so a
      re-mounted repo's hooks require fresh review — see TOOL-LIFECYCLE HOOKS).
    - Electron renderer storage bridge.
    - IndexedDB (enumerated + fallback list).
    - CacheStorage.

If you add new persistence (Caches API, service worker, filesystem handles, etc.):
- Document it next to the helper.
- Integrate into reset pipeline.
- Otherwise stale embeddings/providers may reappear.

Desktop reset order:
1. Dispose embeddings.
2. Clear UI state.
3. Purge DB tables (job_queue, embedding_sets, etc.).
4. Reload renderer.
Do not skip reload.

Database-owned assistant persistence added outside Mastra's tables must also
be cleared explicitly. This includes `brainstrike_assistant_message_parents`,
the assistant-ui carousel/branch topology companion store (migration 055).

Add tests when changing reset behavior.

## RUNTIME DATABASE CORRUPTION RECOVERY

Runtime corruption recovery replaces the active local database and reloads the
visible renderer. The failing operation belongs to the old database snapshot
and MUST NOT be retried against the empty replacement.

Desktop order:
1. Invalidate the desktop scheduler generation and reject new DB work until
   renderer reload begins. Every scheduler handed to backfills or other detached
   work must route through the same generation check.
2. Cancel active embedding backfills. Recovery runs inside the single scheduler
   operation after its failing database call has settled. Do not wait for that
   scheduler to become idle from inside recovery: the current operation owns the
   lane. Queued closures can run only after recovery unwinds and must reject
   against the invalidated generation.
3. Unsubscribe renderer live queries.
4. Terminate the DB utility process so all queued requests fail.
5. Back up and replace the active database profile, then initialize migrations.
6. Reload visible windows into the existing bounded startup progress flow.

Recovery is single-flight at the desktop composition root. Hidden renderer
hosts are excluded from visible-window reload routing. Do not replace this with
an unbounded blocking dialog; a recovered IPC call rejects with
`DatabaseCorruptionRecoveredError` and the already-scheduled reload remounts
all renderer state.
