# Derived desktop indexer

### Process ownership

- Keep `@brainstrike/indexer` Node-only and independent of product cutover. Use its Promise-based `IndexerPort`; inference stays in the hidden renderer host.
- Keep one writer worker and a separate read-only, query-only connection in the index process. Join writer/process completion on close; reject pending work on process failure.

Guard: `packages/indexer/__tests__/indexer.integration.test.ts`.

### Profile and incremental identity

- Validate the complete producer profile at commit and vector search: model ID, immutable revision, dtype, dimensions and token cap. Hash every field; the initial vector schema is 384 dimensions.
- Refuse profile/schema mismatches with `rebuild-required` and preserve the existing file. Never erase databases during startup.
- Prepare deterministic, byte-preserving line chunks from an authorized root-relative snapshot and explicit chunk-line policy. Reject stale snapshot plans; reuse a vector only when its stable chunk ID and content/profile hash agree.

### Retrieval and root authority

- Pin the native boundary to sqlite-vec 0.1.9. Keep external-content FTS5 BM25 (`porter unicode61`) and trigram indexes synchronized transactionally with file chunks.
- Restrict requests to roots authorized when the host opened the index. Query each root's vec0 `root_id TEXT PARTITION KEY` before coarse top100 selection and rescore its auxiliary Float32 embeddings by exact cosine distance.
- Preserve empty-root results and reject unauthorized roots; never substitute unrestricted retrieval. Do not perform Node inference or silently fuse a different search mode.

### Canonical syntax metadata

- Accept the existing parser's typed symbols/references alongside a file commit; do not add a parse pass. Keep composite `(file_record_id, seq)` identities and name-based references, with same-file `from_symbol_seq` foreign keys.
- Replace graph metadata in the same file/chunk/vector transaction. Reject invalid batches atomically. Omitted syntax retains graph metadata only for unchanged content; changed content clears stale metadata and reports `not-provided`.

### Persistence and qualification

- Treat the database as derived state. Product cutover must register its owned path and call `destroy()` during factory reset before deleting roots; package `destroy()` joins pending writes and removes only its database/WAL/shared-memory files.
- Mark tests requiring actual native binaries/processes as `.integration.test.ts` and run them through the uncached integration task after building the public artifacts. Do not report these checks as full application or cross-platform acceptance.
