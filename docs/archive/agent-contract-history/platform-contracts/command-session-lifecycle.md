# Persistent command sessions: memory-only, but disposed — evidence

Supports `docs/agents/platform-contracts.md` § "Persistent command-session lifecycle".
Read before adding durable restart survival to the command-session registry or changing its disposal points. The contract holds the rules; this file is the record behind them.

Everything below is extracted verbatim from the contract as it stood before
distillation (2026-09-21). Corrections verified against the code today are
marked inline as **CORRECTION (2026-09-21)**; nothing else is rewritten.

---
The desktop command-session registry is main-process, memory-only state. It is
configured once from the same DB-backed workspace-root resolver as git and the
human terminal, survives renderer reloads, and is never written to the database
or browser storage. Therefore it needs no storage deletion, but it MUST be
disposed before process/database teardown:

- graceful shutdown awaits `disposeDesktopCommandSessions()` inside the
  assistant-server shutdown step;
- factory reset owns a `command-sessions` runtime disposer;
- `fs:removeRoot` disposes only sessions owned by the durable DB root id
  returned by its path-keyed disconnect update (adapter ids can diverge); and
- manager disposal clears retained exited output as well as reaping live PTYs.

Bulk disposal must settle every reap attempt and log a missing PTY exit
acknowledgement; one stuck PTY must never skip later application shutdown steps.

Retained-output reads preserve valid UTF-16 surrogate pairs across bounded page
boundaries. A high surrogate without a following low surrogate fails explicitly
with `invalid-buffer`; it must never produce a retry-without-progress page.

Never log or persist command text, cwd, environment, or retained output. Adding
durable restart survival changes the privacy/reset contract and requires a new
reviewed persistence design; it is not a transparent extension of this registry.
The hosted native-tool bridge preserves that rule with transcript-only
allowlist transforms, producer-owned list/output pages, and an explicit
non-durable native-tool partition that artifact settlement must skip. Do not
replace those pages with generic artifact settlement: that would create a
seven-day copy of memory-only PTY data.
